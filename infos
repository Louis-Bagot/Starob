× Console display: design of hero&shield: @).

× SFML display: IMPORTANT
	- Hitboxes will be ROUND. The position of each object (respectively Heroes and Foes)
	  will be at the CENTER of their sprite.
		Everything will be designed and coded under this assumption.
	- I'll assume until new choice that the shield hitbox is the same size as the Hero's
	- Foe sprites and hitboxes are LESSER OR EQUAL Hero's. will drive popping.
	- all this means:
		. object position is at center of actual sprite position
		. WARNING X AND Y AXIS INVERTED IN SPRITE DISPLAYING. (fuck.)


	=> Things to do:
		- define distance /CHECK
		- adapt every freaking bit of code to this assumption in any Hero and Foe code
			this englobes:
				- constructors. careful with sprite positions. /TOBE
				- Hero:
					. position: nothing should be to change here. careful again, sprite position
					. shield position: on circle formed by Hero hitbox OR spritesize ? /CHECK
					 	= to decide; for now hitbox=spritesize.
					. valid position: border +/- (3/2)*spritesize /CHECK
					. create hitbox attribute /CHECK
					. SPRITE POSITION UPDATE
				-	Foe:
					. position: nothing to change? - POPPING position: will depend on hero sprite size
					. collisions: distance between both centers is <= sum of hitboxes. check Shield first ! /CHECK
					. hence also create hitbox attribute /CHECK
					. SPRITE POSITION UPDATE
		- handle display.
